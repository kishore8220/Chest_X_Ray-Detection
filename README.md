# Chest X-Ray Detection

Welcome to the **Chest X-Ray Detection** project! This web application utilizes a pre-trained **VGG19 model** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images with accuracy and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features

- **Pneumonia Detection:** Upload a chest X-ray image to identify the presence of pneumonia.
- **Pre-trained Model:** Powered by VGG19 for robust and reliable predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive web application built with Flask.
